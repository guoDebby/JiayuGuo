Memo 1
Date: 9/15/2014
From: Jiayu Guo
To: Dr. Yoder

So far, the Etch-a-sketch and buttons-LEDs are combined together programming in JavaScript language. 
For Week 1, the Etch-a-sketch was finished in C language as Homework1. This week I wrote up the buttons- LEDs corresponding, and translated Homework1 from C to JavaScript.
On the board the 4 LEDs corresponding to those 4 buttons, as well as the grid of characters shows where the pen controlled by buttons has been. 
Once push up button the up LED will light on, and so on. And also there is a clear button which is used to clear whole grid at as time display a clearing message on screen.
Hardware wiring: Pin11, 13, 17, 18 are used as buttons and pin12, 14, 15, 16 are used as LEDs; pin23 is used as clear button. 
I was using digitaRead() and a big while loop to do this homework before. But my new program with interrupt is more efficiency!
Up to this point, I learn how to read in buttons by interrupt and digitalRead(), and how to deal with the signal read in. 
I got more familiar with JavaScript (BoneScript). At the same time I am work on C, since I like C.
