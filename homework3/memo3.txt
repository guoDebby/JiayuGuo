Subject: Memo2 for Etch and Temp Sensor

This week I finished the i2c temperature sensors communicate with BeagleBone, 
and added the Led matrix to Etch program. Switch two buttons to a rotary encoder.
For the Temperature sensors, one has address pin set to 1, the other one set to 0. 
In the program, I can set the High temperature limited and Low temperature limited separately 
by different addresses. Once the temperature higher or lower than limited value, 
alert pin will sent signal to BeagleBone. And then BeagleBone will display the alert message. 
I write up setting limited values and read temperature in shell, 
and reading alert in JavaScript.
For the Led matrix, I download i2c package for JavaScript, added it to my homwork3 etch.js. 
And also I change two buttons to a rotary encoder, I tried to modify the device tree to use 
Eqep0 and Eqep1, but both fail. For now I can only use Eqep2. Instead of pushing button1 and 
button2 to go up and down, I use the rotary encoder to control the vertical direction.
In this homework3, I realize I should not modify anything that is not supposed to be changed 
in the BeagleBone (like I changed the node to older version by mistake). Finally I have to reflash my sd card.
