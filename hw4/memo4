For part 1 GPIO via mmap, I wrote a C program using mmap to read two switches and display on separate two LEDs. Firstly I modified the set shell file to map the GPIO pins, and then run the C file. 
For part 2 Rotary Encoder, I modified the Devicetree .dts file to empty the GPIO for eQEP1 and eQEP2, and then added two rotary encoders to etch.js. Instead of using four buttons, I use two Encoder to control the direction of etch. 
For part 3 Web control, I copy the realtime folder to my directory, and modified the matrixLED.js and matrixLED.css to meet all requirements in homework.
1. Once run BoneSever.js, the program is listening to the web. When you connect to MatrixLed demo, the message “matrix” is sent to Beaglebone. And then i2c is setup to transmit data between beaglebone and web.
2. When click LED in the browser, the LED matrix on the beaglebone side will responding light on at the same position. 
3. Green.
4. The color state is saved in matrixLED.css, and in matrixLED.js I create a click step array to record the status of each LED’s color.
