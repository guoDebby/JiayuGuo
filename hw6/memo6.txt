Listing 4-4
Under this configuration mode, the OMAP device (BeagleBone) is connected, and USB configures are enabled. In the kernel configure file from the textbook, the USB is not set.
Listing 4-5
The autoconf.h file is generated by the configure file, which indicated the USB features are enabled in this case. Comparing to the textbook, textbook donâ€™t have much enabled feature.
Listing 4-6
All the functions targets are given by the make help file. In this case, it shows the functions that BeagleBone has, but not exist in the textbook. 
Listing 4-8
In the BeagleBone, there much more options for each configure mode than textbook has.
Listing 4-11
More lines are needed in the BeagleBone than the textbook, since there are more configurations need to be done in the BeagleBone.
CONFIG_CPU_V7 is found in the autoconf.h file, which has value 1. CONFIG_CPU_V6 and CONFIG_CPU_V6K have not been set up.
The start_kernel is included in main.c, which is in /kernel/init/. In the head.S file, start_Kernel dose the branch from line96 to line103.
