Memo 1

  So far, the Etch-a-sketch and buttons-LEDs are combined together programming in javascript language.
  On the board the 4 LEDs corresponding to those 4 buttons, as well as the grid of characters shows where the pen controlled by buttons has been.
  Once push up button the up LED will light on, and so on. And also there is a clear button which can clear whole grid.
  Pin11,13,17,18 are used as buttons and pin12,14,15,16 are used as LEDs; pin23 is used as clear button.
  I was using digitalread and a while loop to do this home work. But my new program with interrupt is more efficiency!
